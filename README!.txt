About.

SCAR (Skilldex Colour Astetic Redux) is graphical overhaul for skilldex pictures in fallout 2. I used my own colour palette but convert it later on to default fallout2. This mod should change all skilldex perks from original f2 and f2 restoration mod as well.

But why?

Because I want a bit more life and fun in my game.
